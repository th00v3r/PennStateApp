				<h3> <a name = "Coding">Coding and Computer Science</a></h3>
				<br>
			
			
					<p class = "tab">  
						Coding is a way to more fully understand the backbone of what is happening in devices all around us.  I was introduced to coding my junior year in my AP Computer Science class.  This led me to take post-AP Data Structures and Algorithms this year in which I will be coding an app as a second semester final project.   
					</p>
					<br>
					<br>


				<h3><a name = "Outdoors">Outdoors</a></h3>
				<br>


					<p class = "tab"> 
						I have grown up hiking, camping and appreciating nature.  While in elementary school, I went on trips with my father and my friends every month.  These adventures were exhilarating and instilled in me my passion for the outdoors.  This continued as I grew older and joined Boy Scouts.  Backpacking through North Georgia, North Carolina and in Philmont, New Mexico were significant steps on my journey from boy to man. 
					</p>
					<br>
					<p class = "tab">
						When I was a boy, I wanted to be a fiddling cowboy.  My childhood years were split between rural, North Georgia and Atlanta, one with Yankee my Appaloosa and the other with Ms. Tracy’s violin lessons, so this notion to be a kind of Renaissance fiddling cowboy did seem possible. I have matured into other career goals now, but I’m still soothed by loping through a field on my horse as much as when I play a bluegrass tune on my violin.
 
					</p>

				<h3><a name = "Food">Global Issues</a></h3>
				<br>


					<p class = "tab">
						My high school explores a global theme every year and examines it as it relates to science and technology, culture and arts, social entrepreneurship and business, service and environmental sustainability.  My three topics of study have been Water, Food, and Climate.  This program prepared me to be a global learner and a leader.  

					</p>
					<br>
					<p class = "tab">
						During the year of "water", we studied the impacts of droughts and other extreme water situations.  Throughout the school year, education around water and water issues were supported by curricular and hands-on activities in the school.  The student body was called upon to find sustainable solutions for some of the most complex and challenging problems our planet has ever faced. I was a semi-finalist in a social entrepreneurship competition for developing Portable Underwater Generator (PUG) with the intent of recreational outdoor use along with humanitarian aid as a natural power solution. 
					</p>
					<br>
					<p class = "tab">
						During the year of "food", we studied how food binds together all people in their struggle for survival while highlighting the differences between cultures, beliefs, socio-economic status, religions, races, families, and individuals.  I also had the opportunity to be an Isdell Center for Global Leadership (ICGL) Global Scholar. I was one of four students selected from the upper school to work together throughout the year to explore food through travel, research and an independent-study course.  

 					</p>
 					<br>
 					<p class = "tab">
 						During the current year of "climate", we are looking at issues like how climate change is happening faster than ever before, how humans are affected if average temperatures rise, and how this most recent climate shift compares to other historical climate changes.  Once again, teachers will incorporate the issue of climate into their classes, enlightening the student body as a whole.  This year, I was selected as a member of the ICGL Student Advisory Board.  This allows me to lead efforts, to collaborate with teachers and the leadership team, and to educate other students and the community about climate change.

				<h3><a name = "Engineereing">Engineering and Design</a></h3>
					<br>	

					<p class = "tab">
						Ever since I was a child, I have been enthralled with building things.  When presented the challenge of a lego set, I worked tirelessly until it was completed.  The day after I received the Eiffel Tower set, I worked 14 hours to try and complete it, and then hours again the next day.  I want to transfer this enthusiasm and dedication to where I go to college and into my career.  
					</p>
					<br>
					<p class = "tab">
						When I toured Penn State, I felt at home.  No other school has had the same energy as when I visited the Leonhard building and heard Dr. Shanbhag talk about what students are learning.  Then I saw the industrial engineering lab in action.  Wow. I could not wait to get busy with the incredible amount of resources that are available.  
					</p>
					<br>
					<br>



				<h3><a name = "Job">Goals</a></h3>
				<br>


					<p class = "tab">
						Either through direct relation with my career or through hobbies, I will reflect my passions in my life path.  I will give back to others because others have given so much to me.  Service will be a part of what I do in the future as well.  Sir Winston Churchill said, "We make a living from what we get, yet we make a life from what we give."  In my life, I will live in such a way that it is more important to give than to get.  
					</p>
					<br>
					
					<p class = "tab">
						Global education has changed who I am.  Critical thinking about how to improve the world with empathy at the core is what I discovered as a Global Scholar.  I want to build on the opportunities I have had around global education and pursue deeper global engagement through the shared global perspective of Schreyer Honors College.      

					</p>
					<br>

					<p class = "tab">
					 	 After college, I plan to pursue a career in engineering or computer science.  My strengths and interests point specifically to industrial engineering, yet I also want to give back through service.  When I think of the opportunities at Penn State, I dare to dream that perhaps I can utilize engineering and technology skills and make a global impact in the natural world that I love so much to explore.  I am ecstatic to continue into the next phase of my life at Penn State. WE ARE!
